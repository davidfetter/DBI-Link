When using DBD::Oracle, you need to see to it that it will load
correctly.  If DBD::Oracle doesn't work correctly, try building
DBD::Oracle as follows:

perl Makefile.PL
perl -pi -e 's(LD_RUN_PATH.*)(LD_RUN_PATH=$ENV{ORACLE_HOME}/bin)' Makefile
make && make test && make install

If your Oracle database has more than 1000 tables and views in it, you
will need to change ora_array_chunk_size to a number large enough to
contain it.  See examples/oracle/oracle.sql for how to do this.
