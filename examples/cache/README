README.ODBC:
When building DBD::ODBC and using libiodbc, you might need to specify
the directory of the iODBC includes. I did this by exporting
CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/iodbc", in addition to the other environment
variables Makefile.pl expects.

In the example directory, the username is LIVE:DAVIDB simply due to a
quirk of the system I'm connecting to. (Intersystem's Cache' splits
the part off before the colon as something similar to a namespace.)
