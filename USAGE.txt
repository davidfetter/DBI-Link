Here is how to use what you have:

As database superuser (often postgres, but check for your system), do
the following:

1.  Load PL/Perlu into your database.  See the createlang documents
for details on how to do this.

2.  Load DBI.sql, which will make the underlying methods aka functions
available.

3.  Load make_connection.sql, which will create a function called
make_accessor_functions.

4.  Invoke make_accessor_functions using a DBI source.  test_pg.sql
has an example that's pretty certain not to work on your system.
