This file represents items to be addressed.

1.  Investigate putting $dbh handles in %_SHARED for quicker write operations.

2.  Some kind of better documentation system, possibly docbook.  This should
be able to generate HTML, PDF, POD(?) and others as needed.

3.  Better testing for each foreign data source.  Should these include
different versions of foreign data sources?

4.  Data type mappings for each DBI data source type:

* DB2
* Excel(?)
* Firebird
* Informix
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Sybase

5. Some way to materialize the foreign data source into real PostgreSQL
tables.
